# Astre
Astre ('Celestial body' in French) is an interpreted programming language designed by AFSE [Academy For Software Engineering (High School)] students: Sullivan Baczynski-Bruce, and Wahid Hussain. Their contributions are described more in-depth later... Happy-Coding!

# Theory

This project has taken many values from Sully's experience and have implements them into the interpreter.
Most importantly:

1. Readability: Functions should be kept to as little lines as possible to prevent confusion
2. Strict Initialization: This language's interpreter only initializes values *outside* of loops, meaning that
   the rate at which new memory is initialized & deleted is kept to a minimum.

# Workloads

This project is developed & maintained by Sullivan Baczynski-Bruce & Wahid Hussain, the following workloads show what has (and what needs to be) done by whom.

- [x] Lexical Analysis (Sully)
- [x] Parsing (Sully)
- [ ] Intermediate Code Representation (Sully)
- [x] Runtime [Currently interpreted (Sully)]
- [ ] Standard Library (Wahid)
